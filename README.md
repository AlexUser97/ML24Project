# Improvement of Tabular Embeddings - Deep Learning Dorks
This repository contains the project "Improvement of Tabular Embeddings" for the Machine Learning 2024 course at Skoltech. The project is developed by the Deep Learning Dorks team.

# Overview
Tabular data has become increasingly important in modern machine learning applications. However, traditional methods for handling tabular data often struggle to capture complex relationships and interactions between features. This project aims to explore and improve the use of embeddings for tabular data, which can provide a more expressive and flexible representation of categorical and numerical features.

# Features:
- Embedding Models: Implementations of various embedding models for tabular data
- Preprocessing: Utilities for data preprocessing, including feature engineering and data normalization.
- Evaluation: Scripts for evaluating the performance of embedding models on various tabular datasets.
- Visualization: Tools for visualizing the learned embeddings and their relationships

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Detailed instructions on how to set up the environment and run the experiments are provided in the README file.

# Usage
The repository is structured to facilitate easy experimentation and reproducibility. Each model implementation is contained within its own directory, along with any associated scripts for training and evaluation. Users can easily swap out different models and datasets to conduct their own experiments.

# Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have suggestions for improvements or find any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
